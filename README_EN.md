## Quick Start

No deployment needed — after starting the OpenCode backend locally, access the hosted frontend directly:

```bash
opencode serve --cors "https://lehhair.github.io"
```

Then open https://lehhair.github.io/OpenCodeUI/

## Docker Deployment (Frontend Only)

For scenarios where `opencode serve` is already running, you only need a frontend UI container to connect to the existing backend.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lehhair/OpenCodeUI.git
cd OpenCodeUI

# Start (connects to host's opencode serve :4096 by default)
docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up -d
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

**Connect to a remote backend:**

```bash
BACKEND_URL=your-server.com:4096 PORT=8080 docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up -d
```

| Environment Variable | Default                     | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `BACKEND_URL`        | `host.docker.internal:4096` | opencode serve address (without protocol prefix) |
| `PORT`               | `3000`                      | Frontend listening port                          |

## Docker Deployment

### Architecture & Ports

The deployment consists of three services, unified through the Gateway:

| Service  | Port                  | Description                                         |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Gateway  | 6658 (`GATEWAY_PORT`) | Unified entry point, reverse proxy for all requests |
| Gateway  | 6659 (`PREVIEW_PORT`) | Dev service preview                                 |
| Frontend | 3000 (internal)       | Static frontend                                     |
| Backend  | 4096 (internal)       | OpenCode API                                        |
| Router   | 7070 (internal)       | Dynamic port routing (built into Gateway)           |

### Gateway Routing Rules

Requests on port `6658` are forwarded according to these rules:

| Path         | Target         | Description                    |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `/api/*`     | Backend :4096  | OpenCode API, supports SSE     |
| `/routes`    | Router :7070   | Dynamic route management panel |
| `/preview/*` | Router :7070   | Preview port switching API     |
| Other        | Frontend :3000 | Frontend static assets         |

Port `6659` is used to access dev services inside the container. The Router automatically scans ports `3000-9999` and generates preview links via the `/p/{token}/` path.

### Deployment Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lehhair/OpenCodeUI.git
cd OpenCodeUI

# Copy and edit environment variables, fill in at least one LLM API Key
cp .env.example .env

# Start
docker compose up -d
```

Visit `http://localhost:6658`.

### Environment Persistence (Simplified)

The backend now retains only one core persistent volume: `opencode-home` (mounted at `/root`).

The backend entry script automatically verifies and supplements `opencode` / `mise` on startup to prevent toolchain loss after container rebuilds.

- OpenCode configuration and session cache
- npm / cargo / pip and other user-space caches
- Node / Python multi-version runtimes installed via `mise`

All of the above will be preserved after container rebuilds — no need to split into multiple small volumes.

When upgrading from older versions, the original `opencode-data/opencode-config/opencode-cache/opencode-npm/opencode-cargo/opencode-local/opencode-opt` volumes become orphaned and can be manually cleaned up after confirming data has been migrated.

First time entering the backend container, you can install and persist runtime versions directly:

```bash
docker compose exec backend mise use -g node@22 python@3.12
docker compose exec backend node -v
docker compose exec backend python -V
```

The `gateway` still retains a separate volume `opencode-router-data` for storing dynamic routing state.

### Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file with the key configuration:

```env
# LLM API Key (fill in at least one)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Ports
GATEWAY_PORT=6658
PREVIEW_PORT=6659

# Working directory (mounted to /workspace in the container)
WORKSPACE=./workspace

# Must be set for public deployment
OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME=opencode
OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-strong-password

# Router service
ROUTER_SCAN_INTERVAL=5
ROUTER_PORT_RANGE=3000-9999
ROUTER_EXCLUDE_PORTS=4096
```

### Reverse Proxy

Docker listens on `127.0.0.1` by default; public deployment requires a reverse proxy in front.

**Nginx:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name opencode.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6658;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # SSE (required)
        proxy_set_header Connection '';
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;

        # WebSocket
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    }
}

# Preview (optional, recommended to use a separate domain)
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name preview.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6659;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    }
}
```

**Caddy:**

```caddyfile
opencode.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:6658 {
        flush_interval -1
    }
}

preview.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:6659
}
```

> **Important**: SSE requires buffering to be disabled. Nginx needs `proxy_buffering off`, Caddy needs `flush_interval -1`.

## Local Development

Requires a running [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) backend.

```bash
opencode serve

# In another terminal
git clone https://github.com/lehhair/OpenCodeUI.git
cd OpenCodeUI
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite starts at `http://localhost:5173`, `/api` is automatically proxied to `http://127.0.0.1:4096`.

### Pre-PR Validation

Before opening a PR, run the same validation steps locally that CI uses:

```bash
npm run validate
```

This command runs TypeScript validation, ESLint, unit tests, and a production build in sequence.

If you prefer the hyphenated name, this alias is also available:

```bash
npm run type-check
```

GitHub Actions runs the same checks in the `Build Validation` workflow for every PR and every push to `main`.

### Release Preparation

For a real release, prefer the command below. It runs the full validation suite first, then updates versions and the changelog:

```bash
npm run release:prepare -- 0.2.0
```

After it finishes, follow the printed `git commit`, `git tag`, and `git push` steps.

## Desktop App

Download the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/lehhair/OpenCodeUI/releases), or build locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

> **macOS users**: If the app shows "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" and gets moved to Trash, run this command in Terminal to remove the quarantine attribute:
>
> ```bash
> xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OpenCode.app
> ```
